We should use a simple two-polar system : Symbol - Instance
Addtionaly, we should use a prefab system with weak link(?)

Here comes more question:
	
	Is there symbol always wraps in an addtional layer (like in flash), just an obj with certain value predefined?
	
	Will the play must create a symbol before placing anything onbmo_12
	
	
	

All Data, is just a collection of properties. What are editable on instance-level or not is the question.
