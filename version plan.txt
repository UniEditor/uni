=========================================================
Uni shall use plain version number:
	
mainVersion.subVersion.buildNumber


MainVersion will change only if incompatiblity in extension, project file, or changes important enough happens
SubVersion will change if corresponding mileStone is reached
BuildNumber will change whenever a stable version is released


=========================================================
I have planned serveral mileStones for Uni, each with a subversion name:
