What an extension can do/be?

1 Create Hs Extension

All hs Extesion will all inited when program starts,
and will be running at backgrounds, with access to
all data stored in Uni
Extension will also be fired under command menu

--create an hs file and put to ext folder

2 Create Panel

Programe will scan xml files, if valid, will create a item in panel
All panels are extenstions
There could be an extension 

--create an xml file and put to ext folder (need to meet format)
--usually a hs to bind with

3 Create New DataTypes

--UniSprite
--UniSpriteRender
--Register new types in TypeList.xml (so that to display in lib panel)

4 Create New ProGroups

--





User levels




----
all files .hs will be run once at program init
all files .hs will be treated as a ext each
all callbacks need to be registered

folders: commands, exporters, extensions do not affect how exts behave, just arrangement for structured display in menu bar

for panels, there must be an valid xml indicating which ext,it binds



----------

On the binding of script and ui xml

Visual things, even commands (things to be gathered and listed) all require xml define, in which it binds an ext script
The script should register relevent event in advance to receive the visual events(panelOpen, dialogCancel...)

Needs:
	
Panels <panel ext="exiId"/> onPanelOpen onPanelClose
Dialogs <dialog ext="exiId"/> onDialogOpen onDialogConfirm onDialogCancel
Commands <command ext="exiId"/> onCommandExecute
Exporters <dialog ext="exiId"/>
Pure Ext

Problems:

Script id is set by code, not good
