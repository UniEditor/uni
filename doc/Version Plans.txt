=========================================================
Uni shall use plain version number:

mainVersion.subVersion.buildNumber
MainVersion will change only if incompatiblity in extension, project file, or changes important enough happens
SubVersion will change if corresponding mileStone is reached
BuildNumber will change whenever a stable version is released
