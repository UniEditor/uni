Drfferent from Godot:
	
	Uni is just an editor, engine-indepedent.
	Uni focusing on game data. It is unique that it supports vector, map, bitmap game data directly
	More, uni aimes to be so open and extensive to be an a platform for unlimited type of data
	
Learn from Godot:
	
	Only one file can be opened at a time.
	One file can be instanced in another file like a zipped symbol
	That symbol is always dynamicly loaded
	That symbol can be break and expose the inside.
	Instancing can only be accepted within same project.

We should use a simple two-polar system : Symbol - Instance
Addtionaly, we should use a prefab system with weak link(?)

Here comes more question:
	
	Is there symbol always wraps in an addtional layer (like in flash), just an obj with certain value predefined?
	
	Will the play must create a symbol before placing anything onbmo_12
	
All Data, is just a collection of properties. What are editable on instance-level or not is the question.

Official Data Types:

UniSprite
	Is the general object, it will be a univerisal sprite of your game, main character, enemies and such.
	It may have different render types.
	
UniTilemap
	Tilemap came in different styles(2D square, 2.5D with walls, Iso, Sixsided and such)
	Each tile should have its own costome data
	
UniShape
	Vector data are important in may games
	Single Points, Lines, Enclosed Lines, Circles, [Curcled Object]
	Each Point should have its own costome data

UniMap
	Diff from shape is that, any two point can be linked and each link should have its own data
	
UniBitmap
	Games like Worms series, Where is My Water have been using bitmap to create freeformed ground.
	Bitmap should have multiple layers

UIThings
	Image(scale9) Button(multi-states) ScaleContent BitmapText(Numbers)
